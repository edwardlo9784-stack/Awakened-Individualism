<h3>📜 Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper presents "Awakened Individualism" as a third path transcending traditional collectivism and individualism. It posits that life is a non-quantifiable "organic format," criticizing current systems that impose "inorganic rules," academic thresholds, and "pseudo-technology" as shackles. Driven by a "healthy egoism" in human nature, and supported by a transparent AI ethics charter controlled by all humanity, this framework aims for the ultimate state where power dissolves: where everyone is both a ruler and the ruled. It emphasizes that perfecting the "small self" inherently completes the "greater self," achieving a self-correcting organic social evolution.</p>

<h3>Chapter One: Core Ethical Axioms – Non-Quantifiable Life and the Source of Responsibility</h3>
<p><b>1.1 The Singular Nature of Life</b><br>Life is an "organic format" of dynamic evolution found in nature, possessing intrinsic pulsation and self-correction functions. This paper introduces the core axiom: <b>Life is non-quantifiable</b>. Any attempt to put a price on life or include it in a mathematical formula (e.g., 1 person < 5 people) is a mutilation of its organic essence and the beginning of tyranny.</p>
<p><b>1.2 The Source of Responsibility Theory</b><br>Deconstructing the "Trolley Problem": Responsibility lies entirely with the "kidnapper" (the system or structure) that created the dilemma. The awakened individual refuses to make a choice of sacrifice between 1 and 5 people, thereby protecting individual sovereignty and ending the pre-enactment of tyranny.</p>

<h3>Chapter Two: Human Dynamics – Healthy Egoism</h3>
<p><b>2.1 Egoism as a Healthy Evolutionary Drive</b><br>While human nature is complex, the common underlying drive is egoism. This framework acknowledges its legitimacy and views it as the engine of systemic operation.</p>
<p><b>2.2 Helping Others as a Byproduct of Egoism</b><br>People help others because "it makes them happy"; the healthy motivation is the internal psychological reward. The benefit to others is a positive "byproduct" of high-quality egoistic behavior.</p>

<h3>Chapter Three: Material Practice – Technological Authenticity and Anti-Homogenization</h3>
<p><b>3.1 Identifying "Pseudo-Technology" and Supply-Side Hegemony</b><br>Critique of major tech giants like Apple for faking mainstream demand and mutilating features (e.g., removing the headphone jack, using AI synthesis over physical optical truth). These acts are designed to create digital dependence and shorten product lifespan.</p>
<p><b>3.2 Safeguarding Physical Sovereignty</b><br>The awakened individual chooses specific tools to defend access to physical truth (Hi-Res, physical interfaces). This includes choices like the Sony Xperia 1 VI, Asus ROG Phone, and Fiio players, rejecting planned obsolescence.</p>
<p><b>3.3 Note on Case Selection:</b><br>The specific hardware mentioned herein serves solely as representative samples that align with the logic of "Awakened Individualism" within the current technological environment. Their core significance lies in the physical interface continuity, openness of technical standards, and respect for physical truth they embody. This theory does not endorse any single brand commercially but encourages individuals to customize tools that meet their evolutionary needs based on the principle of "technological authenticity."</p>

<h3>Chapter Four: Politics and Governance – De-Nationalization and the Dissolution of Power</h3>
<p><b>4.1 The Dissolution of Power and Internalized Sovereignty</b><br>The essence of power lies in dominating the will of others. When individuals achieve the awakened state of being "unable to be influenced by others' will," power dissolves as it loses its target. Everyone becomes both a ruler (governing the self) and the ruled (adhering to consensus).</p>
<p><b>4.2 Organic Self-Correction and Responsibility</b><br>When power returns to the individual, the consequences of decisions are shared by all humanity. This mechanism prompts deep self-reflection, allowing society to operate with the resilience and correction capabilities inherent in organic evolution, moving beyond single-minded nationalism and historical conflicts.</p>

<h3>Chapter Six: Social Evolution – Thought Virus and Natural Selection</h3>
<p><b>6.1 The Thought Virus Propagation Theory</b><br>Awakening does not rely on traditional educational pipelines but propagates spontaneously like a biological virus through the cracks in the system's "dye vat." When societal pressure causes the internal "rubber band" to snap, survival instincts drive individuals to download and resonate with this philosophy.</p>
<p><b>6.2 Non-Violent Sanctions and Evolutionary Selection</b><br>The system self-purifies through "resource disconnection." Those adhering to old logic (harming others for self-gain, power dominance) will be naturally selected out, like dinosaurs unable to adapt to the new organic system.</p>

<h3>Chapter Seven: Conclusion – The Civilizational Leap from Regret to Compassion</h3>
<p>This philosophical system begins with rational observation and concludes with a sensitive awakening. My love for all humanity is the final atonement for the lover I once hurt. By perfecting the "small self," we complete the "greater self"; as humanity returns to the bottom-up protocols of our shared origin, we achieve a genuine, self-correcting individual freedom.</p>

<h3>🙏 Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>I must offer my deepest respect and gratitude to a woman who profoundly impacted my life.</p>
<p>At twenty-one years old, when I was at my most arrogant, attempting to examine all individuals through a quantitative lens, it was her appearance and ultimate departure that forced me to experience the pain and shattering of my "internal rubber band." This pain compelled me to face the flaws in my own logic, making me realize that life is a non-quantifiable universe, not a specimen for observation.</p>
<p>Though time is irreversible and I cannot compensate her for the trouble I caused, without her intuitive and resolute departure, the "me" who today can see human essence and is determined to protect the interests of all humanity would not exist. I quietly dedicate this paper on "human awakening" and "peaceful coexistence" to her. This is the most profound proof of action I can offer for that regret over the past seven years.</p>
<p>May all authentic souls like hers be treated with gentleness in the awakened world of the future, no longer harmed by the environment.</p>
